Why invest in website speed optimization?
######Improve your user experience :
Almost 90 percent of people shop with a competitor after a poor user experience (UX), which can include not only your page speed but also other features, like your navigation. That’s why more businesses are investing in page speed optimization, as well as UX testing.
Not to mention, a better user experience means that website visitors will spend more time on your site and be less likely to bounce to a competitor’s site.

#####Accelerate your conversion rate : 
With page speed optimization, your website’s conversion rates can move to a whole new level. Just a one-second increase in your page speed can boost conversion rates by seven percent. What does that kind of growth look like, though?
Compare the average cost of page speed optimization, which is $50 to $12,000, to those losses. If your company makes a $1000 per day, you would make back the cost of your site speed optimization services and then some in a year.

Why lose that money if your company can make it, instead?

####Maximize your time 
While you could do site speed optimization on your own, it would take a lot of time and knowledge.
If you’re running your own business, department, or projects, your website is one small blip on the radar when it comes to your responsibilities. And, chances are, you don’t have the time to focus your efforts on page speed, and neither does anybody else at your company.
####Increase your website traffic
More than 70 percent of businesses and 80 percent of consumers start their research for a new product or service online. In most cases, they rely on a search engine like Google, Bing, or Yahoo to help them find what they’re looking for. That’s why more than 50 percent of users discover a new company after a search.

Improving your page speed, as well as optimizing your webpages for SEO, helps you rank better in relevant search results. With a better position in search results, your website can earn more valuable traffic. While traffic can sometimes appear as a vanity metric, it’s still useful.

For example, you can see how much traffic you’re driving to your site and how much of that traffic converts. That can help your SEO agency or in-house team discover new ways to improve your strategy, such as by upgrading your website with UX testing.

If your website doesn’t have the speed to rank in search results, however, your team never receives that data that could potentially improve your website.

######Enhance your SEO strategy
Google considers more than 200 ranking factors when developing its search results. While your business needs a smart and competitive SEO strategy, it also requires a fast website. That’s why page speed optimization is so valuable to companies investing in SEO.

With a fast and optimized website, your business can earn a valuable place in relevant search results. It’s an enormous win, as 75 percent of users stick to the first page of search results, while only 25 percent click to the second page.

If you want to maintain your rankings in search results, however, site speed optimization needs to become an ongoing strategy, like SEO. By making site speed optimization a long-term part of your digital marketing strategy, you can maximize the results of your SEO.
